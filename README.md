Introduction
============

Breeze is a lightweight PHP web application framework, providing the ability to use sensible URL schemes to process actions and give meaningful feedback to users... And little more. When you need to spin up a PHP application quickly and don't want to have to worry about digging through a heavier framework, such as CakePHP, to make sure you're getting your job done with minimal overhead, Breeze is probably for you.

Breeze functions best in an Apache environment and when run out-of-the-box expects to have the ability to configure mod_rewrite from the .htaccess file. If you don't know what any of that means, Breeze is probably not for you.

Installation
============

Set the document root of your site to the "app" folder in the Breeze redistributable, configure your database connection in `config/database.php`, and start creating controllers, models, and views.

This is preliminary documentation so stay tuned for more in-depth tutorials.
